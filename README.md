# Analyzing Categorical VAE Latent Space with NPMI

This repository contains proof-of-concept analysis code that applies NPMI (Normalised Pointwise Mutual Information) techniques to explore the latent space of a categorical VAE trained on MNIST. The NPMI methodology is adapted from the paper [Speaking Your Language: Spatial Relationships in Interpretable Emergent Communication](https://openreview.net/forum?id=vIP8IWmZlN).

## Overview

The project demonstrates how NPMI analysis techniques, originally developed for studying emergent communication, can be applied to understand the learned representations in a categorical Variational Autoencoder (VAE).

The VAE implementation is based on code from [https://github.com/jxmorris12/categorical-vae](https://github.com/jxmorris12/categorical-vae).
